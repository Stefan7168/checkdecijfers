# ADR 027 — Finder precision: question-aware rerank + in-job measure-fit gate with candidate fallback (#111)

**Status:** accepted (design frozen session 30, 2026-07-07/08; owner authorized Fable for this design
step; **amended same session after a 3-lens adversarial design review** — the amendments are marked
inline). Build not started.

## Context

The first real live onboarding — *"Hoeveel mensen zaten er in 2023 in de bijstand?"* — dead-ended: the
finder confidently picked `85615NED` (a FLOW table: bijstand in/outflows) over a stock/count table,
delivery correctly found no fitting measure, and 100 credits were refunded. Owner verdict (binding):
simple questions MUST answer, and the fix must be **general**, never per-topic aliases.

Three verified code facts bound the design (problem dossier, [2026-07-07-111-problem-dossier.md](../session-briefs/2026-07-07-111-problem-dossier.md)):

1. The finder receives only the parser's `unmatchedMeasureTerm` ("bijstand") — the question's shape
   ("hoeveel mensen **zaten er in**" = stock) is discarded before Stage 1 runs.
2. The Stage-2 rerank sees only id/status/type/title/240-char summary — no measure names, no
   dimensions. Topic-word overlap is exactly the signal that misleads (the flows table's
   title/summary match "bijstand" *better* than a kerncijfers table).
3. Fit is only tested AFTER the 100-credit debit, at delivery — and the rerank's `alternativeIds`
   never survive the confident path (they are dropped INSIDE `findTable`'s confident branch,
   `src/catalog/find.ts` — review correction: not "at the trigger boundary"; the confident
   `FindTableOutcome` variant must be WIDENED to carry them), so there is no try-next-candidate.

## Decision (five parts)

**D1 — Shape data comes from a per-candidate `fetchTableSchema` metadata call INSIDE the async job**
(the "fit gate"), not from catalog enrichment and never from the synchronous request path.
`CbsTableSchema` already carries measures (code/title/unit/description) + dimension kinds — one
cheap metadata call, no observation data.

**D2 — The debit stays at trigger time; the fit gate runs in the job BEFORE any ingest, with
try-next-candidate.** Per candidate: fetch schema → fit check → on a genuine "geen" verdict, advance
to the next candidate; ingest + vocabulary + delivery only for the first FITTING candidate. Money
mechanics (debit at trigger, stored-delta refund on any non-delivery) are unchanged; what changes is
that a mis-pick now usually becomes an ANSWER instead of a refund.

**D2a (review amendment — identity vs resolution).** `pending_table_requests.table_id` is **never
mutated**: it stays the original confident pick, preserving (i) the `(user_id, table_id)` active-
unique partial index (a `running` row IS inside its predicate — the original design's "safe while
running" claim was backwards) and (ii) the asking-twice-costs-nothing dedupe, which keys on it. The
fit gate's choice lands in a NEW nullable column **`resolved_table_id`** (outside the index);
ingest/vocabulary/delivery read `resolved_table_id ?? table_id`. This also makes retries
deterministic: `resolved_table_id` is persisted BEFORE ingest, and a reclaimed re-attempt that finds
it set SKIPS the fit loop and resumes at ingest — one request can never ingest two tables across
attempts.

**D2b (review amendment — errors are not verdicts).** A per-candidate metadata-fetch or fit-LLM
ERROR advances to the next candidate but is recorded as *errored*, not *misfit*. End states: at
least one candidate ACCEPTED → proceed; all candidates got verdicts and none fit → `unanswerable`
with the honest scoped message ("geen van de **onderzochte** tabellen bevat een maat die deze vraag
beantwoordt"); ALL candidates errored (nothing was ever inspected — the correlated CBS/LLM-outage
case) → `failed` via the existing "Onverwachte fout" path. The product never asserts a fact about
CBS tables it did not verify (principle c), and the owner's diagnostics keep outages distinguishable
from genuine no-fit.

**D2c (review amendment — legacy rows).** A row with empty `candidate_ids` (anything in flight when
the migration deploys, or created by older code) **skips the fit gate entirely** and takes today's
exact path (ingest `table_id` → delivery decides). Deploy-order-safe by construction and the
"legacy behaves exactly as today" test criterion is literally true.

**D3 — The question's shape signal is the FULL QUESTION TEXT, threaded to both LLM steps; no new
parser-side taxonomy.** (a) The Stage-2 rerank prompt gains the full question alongside the topic
term (still a closed shortlist choice, hard allowlist unchanged; the prompt-byte change forces a
full fixture re-record — note the re-record is forced by the BYTES, not by the documentation-only
`RERANK_PROMPT_VERSION` constant; `RERANK_SCHEMA_VERSION` and the prompt's "version is altijd 1"
line refer to the OUTPUT schema and must NOT be touched). (b) The new **measure-fit check** is the
real stock-vs-flow discriminator: a closed choice over the candidate table's OWN measure list
(titles + units + descriptions, verbatim) + an explicit "geen" option, with a hard allowlist on
measure codes — structurally the same safety shape ADR 025 chose. The job already has the verbatim
question (`pending_table_requests.question_text`).

**D4 — Model tier: Haiku for both the widened rerank and the new fit check**, same recorded
Haiku→Sonnet→Fable escalation ladder as ADR 025 decision 3, moved only on a MEASURED miss. Both
steps remain closed multiple-choice over supplied lists; structural safety (allowlist + fail-toward-
disclose/next/refund) does not depend on model size.

**D5 — Measurement first.** Before product code: extend `benchmark/tablefinder-labelled-set.json`
with stock-vs-flow discriminating cases (bijstand-stock must NOT land on `85615NED`; a flow-phrased
question targets `85615NED`; plus the still-missing disclose-expected case — closes the #104 gap),
and add a small measure-fit labelled set. **Sequencing correction (review):** the replay test that
consumes the labelled set sits ON the CI gate, and the new cases need fixtures that can only be
recorded AFTER the prompt change — so the labelled-set additions, the prompt change, and the
re-recorded fixtures merge as ONE gate-green unit whose recording is a short supervised step
(~cents, the session-25 pattern). Both bijstand tables must be ADDED to the hermetic
`_catalog.json` (neither is in the current 61-row fixture) and get per-table fixture docs for the
job e2e tests.

## Mechanics the decision implies

- **The candidate chain is explicit** (review: every carrier named, or the build session strands the
  data): widen `FindTableOutcome`'s confident variant (`src/catalog/types.ts` + `find.ts`) with the
  rerank's allowlist-sanitized `alternativeIds` → `OnboardingRouting.candidateIds`
  (`src/answer/intent/policy.ts`; pick first, then alternatives, cap 3) → the `onboarding`
  `ParseOutcome` variant (`intent/types.ts`) → `OnboardingEnvelope` (`respond/types.ts`; BOTH
  construction sites in `respond/respond.ts`) → `web/app/actions.ts` `maybeTriggerOnboarding` →
  `TriggerOnboardingInput` (`onboarding-trigger.ts`) → `createPendingRequest` + `fromRow`
  (`onboarding-store.ts`).
- **Migration 015**: `candidate_ids jsonb not null default '[]'` + `resolved_table_id text` (both
  outside every index; defaults keep old rows and old code valid in either deploy order).
- The fit gate runs before piggyback/ingest for candidate-carrying rows; the accepted candidate is
  written to `resolved_table_id` via a store helper that updates the DB row AND the in-memory
  `PendingTableRequest` (review: every downstream step reads the in-memory object).
- Only the fitting candidate is ingested + vocabulary-registered on the happy path (a misfit table
  no longer pollutes the registry; across a crash-retry, D2a's resume rule keeps it to one table).
- The delivery-must-answer gate stays untouched as defense in depth: the fit check is an answer-rate
  optimizer, never a validator replacement — a fit-pass that still fails delivery refunds exactly as
  today. R1/R8 untouched: the fit check reads METADATA only, never data cells.
- Money invariant, scoped precisely (review): the LEDGER primitives (`debitOnboarding`,
  `compensate`) and `refundOnboarding` stay byte-identical; `triggerOnboarding`/
  `createPendingRequest` widen to CARRY `candidate_ids` but the debit amount, idempotency keys and
  refund semantics are unchanged.
- Non-confident finder outcomes (disclose/none → B15 clarification) are byte-unchanged; the intent
  parser's prompt is byte-untouched (no new taxonomy — D3), so intent fixtures, thresholds and the
  benchmark are unaffected by construction.

## Alternatives rejected

1. **Catalog-wide shape enrichment at `catalog:refresh`** (store measures per table in `cbs_catalog`):
   principle-(b)-clean but ~4,858 per-table metadata calls per refresh (refresh already takes ~19 min;
   this multiplies it) and ~99% is never used. Revisit trigger: measured SHORTLIST-recall misses —
   i.e. the right table doesn't even enter the top-20, which no rerank/fit improvement can fix.
2. **Shortlist metadata fetch at rerank time (synchronous turn)**: puts live CBS calls in the request
   path (principle (b) exception) and adds seconds to every unmatched-topic turn. Rejected; the async
   job is the sanctioned out-of-band fetch path.
3. **A structured stock|flow|rate hint emitted by the intent parser**: changes the calibrated hot
   prompt for every turn (fixture re-record + R7 threshold re-calibration) to benefit only the finder
   path. Rejected for v1; revisit if the fit check's measured accuracy proves question-text-in-prompt
   insufficient.
4. **Debit AFTER a fit check** (charge only when fit-confirmed): requires sync metadata fetches
   (rejected in 2) or moving money into the background job (worse auditability; the ack copy already
   promises the refund-on-failure semantics). Rejected — the refund mechanism is proven.
5. **Mutating `table_id` to the fitting candidate** (the original sketch): rejected by the design
   review — a `running` row is inside the `(user_id, table_id)` partial-unique predicate (update can
   collide with the user's other active row → spurious terminal failure of a deliverable request),
   and the drifting key silently breaks the asking-twice dedupe (double 100-credit debit window).
   `resolved_table_id` (D2a) provides the same capability with zero index/dedupe interaction.

## Trade-offs accepted

- A mis-picked FIRST candidate now costs one extra metadata fetch + one small LLM call before the
  right table answers — seconds, inside the async wait the user already accepts.
- The fit check can wrongly reject a fitting measure (false "geen") → falls to the next candidate or
  an honest refund; that is the fail-safe direction (principle c). It can also wrongly accept — then
  delivery's existing gate catches it and refunds, exactly today's behavior.
- Two more recorded-fixture LLM surfaces to maintain (rerank v2 prompt, fit prompt) — the eval/replay
  infra for both already exists (sub-part 1 pattern).
- Two different active questions from one user may land on overlapping candidate sets; each request
  resolves independently against its OWN question (two debits for two genuinely different questions
  is correct behavior; the dedupe continues to key on the unchanged original pick).

## Revisit triggers

- Measured shortlist-recall miss (right table absent from the top-20) → alternative 1 (enrichment),
  scoped lazily to shortlist-entered tables first.
- Fit-check measured accuracy < the labelled-set gate after threshold calibration → escalate the
  ladder (Sonnet), then reconsider alternative 3 (parser shape hint).
- Any measured wrong-table CONFIDENT answer reaching a user → tighten `highConfidence`/fit threshold
  first (failure-safe direction), then redesign.
