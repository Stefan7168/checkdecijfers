> **Tracker, not a source of truth.** Scope and the gate are defined in [03-mvp-scope.md](03-mvp-scope.md), the benchmark in

> **Session log lives in [status-archive.md](status-archive.md)** — full per-session "Last updated" entries, verbatim, newest on top.

> Read call: hard-wrap every line at ~150 chars, no kilobyte-long lines.

**▶ NEXT SESSION STARTS HERE (written 2026-09-15, session 103, autonomous throughout — owner sent two
short messages mid-session, "I trust your judgement" then twice "continue to work autonomously," but did
not review any PR; verify against `git log`/`gh pr list` before trusting, since owner-present work may
land after this).** **Six PRs now open, ALL awaiting owner review, NONE merged — this is purely a review
wait, nothing blocks any of them on the tooling side:** #23 (WP30c E1 Eurostat), #24 (health-check
`pro_subscriptions` fix), #25 (dead chart-story cleanup) — all three unchanged since session 102, still
zero comments/reviews — plus **PR #26** (`attachments-envelope-key-manifest`): closes
[#209](open-questions.md), builds `tests/attachments/envelope-key-manifest.test.ts` (the CBS-side
`envelope-key-manifest.test.ts`'s analog for `DatasetTurnEnvelope`, this tier's own R8-analog envelope —
a discriminated union, needing its own sibling declaration-parser rather than reusing the interface-body
one) and, in building it, found and fixed a real pre-existing gap: `reconstruct.ts` never checked
`envelope.schemaVersion` against `DATASET_TURN_ENVELOPE_VERSION` (unlike the CBS side, which always has).
Zero behavior change today (version has never moved past 1); the check now exists before it's needed.
**CI confirmed green** (`gh run list --branch attachments-envelope-key-manifest`, run `34924905497`:
`web`/`backend (1/2/3)` all `success`, `deploy` correctly `skipped`). Plus new **PR #27**
(`shared-is-redacted-helper`): closes [#227](open-questions.md), extracts the three hand-copied
`isRedacted` checks (`web/app/embed-actions.ts`, `web/app/embed/[token]/page.tsx`,
`scripts/verify-audit-rows.ts`) into one export in `src/answer/audit/retention.ts`, re-exported from the
existing audit `index.ts` — zero behavior change, zero new import paths. Deliberately did NOT touch
`scripts/verify-dataset-turns.ts`'s own look-alike `isRedacted` (a different, deliberately separate trust
tier's sentinel — ADR 037 D1). Full verification green (backend 153/2358, web 105/1733, benchmark 28/28,
`test:docs` 11/11, real build, `/code-review` LOW 0 findings) — **CI confirmed green** on both PRs
(run `34924905497` for #26, run `34927043689` for #27, both `conclusion: success`). Plus new **PR #28**
(`fix-use-element-width-reparenting`): closes the actionable half of [#234](open-questions.md) —
`useElementWidth`'s stale-ref bug across both named trigger paths (schema-refusal null→element, and
chart-frame.tsx's Frame Inset toggle reparenting the ref'd node), fixed with one general re-check-every-
render mechanism. **Found and fixed a further real bug in the fix itself before shipping**: Next.js's own
StrictMode-on-by-default in development mounts every component twice, and the unmount-cleanup effect had
to reset BOTH tracking refs (not just disconnect the observer) or the simulated remount would get
permanently stuck — caught by a regression test rendering under a real `<StrictMode>` wrapper, and
independently confirmed in a real browser via the hermetic dev harness (toggled Frame Inset several times
on a real fixture-replay chart, read the actual measured width/height at each step). Full verification
green (backend 153/2358 unaffected, web 105/1736, benchmark 28/28, `test:docs` 11/11, real build,
`/code-review` LOW 0 findings) — **CI confirmed green** (`gh run view` on the PR's run:
`conclusion: "success"`).

## Phase 0 checklist

- [x] Open questions #10, #18, #20 answered by Stefan (2026-07-02 — see [open-questions.md](open-questions.md))
- [x] Doc-set sign-off by Stefan (2026-07-02)
- [x] CBS table set chosen; IDs validated against the live catalog (2026-07-02, open-questions #1 resolved — 8 tables, all v4-reachable, every
      benchmark period confirmed present: [07-phase0-table-set.md](07-phase0-table-set.md))
- [x] Benchmark answer key frozen (2026-07-03: [benchmark/answer-key.json](../benchmark/answer-key.json) — 14/14 answerable tasks + B20 freshness
      reference, values re-verified against the live ingest, not just copied from docs; [02-user-scenarios.md](02-user-scenarios.md), Scoring)
- [x] Ingestion + validation pipeline with fixture tests (2026-07-03: five ordered checks, quarantine, correction-diff log, idempotent syncs; the 10
      inherited `todo` obligations are now 21 real fixture tests + 8 adapter tests on an embedded real-Postgres test DB (ADR
      [009](decisions/009-hermetic-test-database.md)); adversarial review found and fixed 2 ordering/defaulting bugs; live ingest recorded above)
- [x] Table registry + alias list (2026-07-03: ADR [010](decisions/010-registry-canonical-measures.md);
      `cbs_tables.default_coordinates`/`.period_semantics` populated for all 8 tables, `canonical_measures` alias list seeded with 8 canonical
      concepts, applied live and idempotently; 14 hermetic tests incl. cross-checks against the frozen benchmark key)
- [x] Intent parsing (schema-validated, ranked candidates + confidence) (2026-07-03: `src/answer/intent/` per ADR
      [012](decisions/012-intent-parsing-llm-harness.md) — LLM emits registry vocabulary only, deterministic resolution to CBS codes, R7 thresholds
      calibrated at 0.9/0.35 against a 45-case labelled set, 45/45 measured live with zero flips over 3 repeats; CI replays committed LLM fixtures
      hermetically)
- [x] Deterministic query + validation + registered derivations (2026-07-03: `src/query/` per ADR [011](decisions/011-query-contract.md) — intent
      contract fixed for WP6, coordinate result-ids, registered derivations with CC BY marking, ten-kind refusal taxonomy incl. slice-vs-unpublished
      distinction and value-free freshness refusals; B1–B14 reproduce the frozen key + B20 refuses correctly, hermetically in CI)
- [x] Answer composition with verbatim/semantic/unit checks (2026-07-03: ADR [013](decisions/013-answer-composition.md) — `src/answer/compose/` +
      shared LLM harness; R1/R2/R3/R4/R5/R9/R10/R11 answer-side invariant tests real; B1–B14 end-to-end hermetic in CI with zero fabricated numbers;
      14/14 measured live, prompt v3, zero template fallbacks)
- [x] Chart spec + dumb renderer (2026-07-03: `src/chart/` per ADR [014](decisions/014-chart-spec-v1-and-renderer.md) — versioned zod-validated
      ChartSpec v1 built deterministically from validated results, pure dependency-free SVG renderer, R6 real; B4/B8 line charts reproduce the frozen
      key hermetically in CI; Recharts client wrapper deferred to the chat-UI session per ADR 014)
- [x] Refusal & clarification behavior (2026-07-03: ADR [015](decisions/015-refusal-clarification-composition.md) — `src/answer/respond/`
      deterministic templates + one-round clarify-reply merge; B15–B20 6/6 hermetic in CI; staleness both branches clock-injected; clarify-reply
      calibrated live 7/7, zero flips ×3)
- [x] Audit record per answer (R8) (2026-07-03: ADR [016](decisions/016-audit-records.md) — migration 004 `audit_answers`, one row per
      answer/refusal/clarification written before the response returns, fail-closed on audit failure; `reconstructionReport` re-verifies every row
      from the stored row alone with tamper tests proving teeth; benchmark scorer reads audit records: hermetic run/score pair in CI, gate PASS
      measured 14/14 + 6/6 + 0 fabricated)
- [x] CI gate live (2026-07-02): GitHub Actions runs typecheck + the eight gate suites + the benchmark run/score pair on every push. State after WP10
      (2026-07-03): **432 real tests + 0 todos** — the query suite scores B1–B14 against the frozen key (hand-authored intents), the answer suite
      drives B1–B14 **and B15–B20 plus the clarification round** end-to-end over replayed intent/answer/clarify fixtures (ADR
      [012](decisions/012-intent-parsing-llm-harness.md)/[013](decisions/013-answer-composition.md)/[015](decisions/015-refusal-clarification-composition.md)),
      the chart suite proves B4/B8 line charts against the frozen key, the audit suite proves R8 (rows reconstruct, fail-closed, tamper detection),
      and `benchmark:run`+`benchmark:score` produce and score the full 20-task run from audit records (a missing dump is a CI failure) — still no
      secrets and no network. After WP11 (2026-07-03): **445 real tests** — the benchmark suite gained the scorer-teeth tests, which score tampered
      dumps through the real scorer subprocess and pin every docs/03 gate leg (both sides of the ≥12/14 boundary, 6/6, zero-fabricated, the
      fail-closed duplicate-id/missing-dump guards). **After WP12 (2026-07-04): `gate` job also runs `web/`'s own typecheck + 6-test suite; a second
      job, `deploy`, is gated on `gate` via `needs:` and is the only thing that ever deploys (Vercel git integration deliberately not connected) —
      deploy-blocking-on-red is live, not just planned.**
- [x] Provider spend caps, billing alerts, and dependency alerts set (complete 2026-07-04: Anthropic €25/mo spend cap confirmed set 2026-07-02;
      **Anthropic billing alert confirmed set by the owner 2026-07-04** (RUNBOOK step done); **dependency alerts complete** 2026-07-03 — weekly
      grouped version-update PRs via `.github/dependabot.yml`, Dependabot *security alerts* enabled by the owner (verified via the GitHub API,
      `/vulnerability-alerts` → 204), Dependabot *security-update PRs* enabled via the API in WP11 (`/automated-security-fixes` → `enabled: true`);
      web/'s own independent lockfile got a matching second Dependabot entry in WP12)
- [x] Full benchmark run recorded below (2026-07-03, WP11: live run through the audited pipeline — gate criteria measured PASS, see scoreboard;
      provenance in [benchmark/live-benchmark-report.json](../benchmark/live-benchmark-report.json), policy in ADR
      [017](decisions/017-live-benchmark-run.md))
- [x] Minimal chat UI + first deploy (2026-07-04, WP12: [web/](../web/) — Next.js App Router chat UI over the audited entry points, Recharts wrapper
      over ChartSpec v1, CI-gated Vercel deploy; ADR [018](decisions/018-chat-ui-and-deploy.md). **Live at https://checkdecijfers.vercel.app** — all
      four `ComposedResponse` kinds (answer, chart, clarify-then-refusal, direct refusal) measured working against the real deployment)
